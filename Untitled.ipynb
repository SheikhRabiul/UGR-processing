    "Case1 Data scientist: Boolean Rule and Logistic Rule Regression models\n",
    "In evaluating a machine learning model for deployment, a data scientist would ideally like to understand the behavior of the model as a whole, not just in specific instances (e.g. specific loan applicants). This is especially true in regulated industries such as banking where higher standards of explainability may be required. For example, the data scientist may have to present the model to: 1) technical and business managers for review before deployment, 2) a lending expert to compare the model to the expert's knowledge, or 3) a regulator to check for compliance. Furthermore, it is common for a model to be deployed in a different geography than the one it was trained on. A global view of the model may uncover problems with overfitting and poor generalization to other geographies before deployment.\n",

    "Directly interpretable models can provide such global understanding because they have a sufficiently simple form for their workings to be transparent. Below we present two directly interpretable models in the form of a Boolean rule (BR) and a logistic rule regression (LogRR) model. The former is produced by the Boolean Rule Column Generation (BRCG) algorithm while the latter is a generalized linear rule model (GLRM), both implemented in AIX360. While both models are interpretable, they provide different trade-offs between model simplicity and accuracy in predicting loan repayment. BRCG yields a very simple set of rules that has reasonable accuracy. LogRR achieves higher accuracy, higher even than some uninterpretable models, while retaining the form of a linear model. Its interpretation is enhanced by plots as demonstrated below."
